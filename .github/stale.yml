  This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had
  recent activity. This probably means that it is not reproducible
  or it has been fixed in a newer version. If itâ€™s an enhancement
  and hasn't been taken on for so long, then it seems no one has
  the time to implement this.
  Please reopen if you still encounter this issue with the [latest stable version](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html).
  You can also contribute directly by providing a pull request.
  Thank you!
