For å gjera dette, fylja desse stega: 1) Right-click the 'Computer' (or 'My Computer') icon in the 'Start Menu' and select 'Manage'. The 'Computer Management' window should appear. 2) In the 'Computer Management' window, select 'Storage' &gt; 'Disk Management'. 3) Right-click the partition you want to encrypt and select either 'Delete Partition', or 'Delete Volume', or 'Delete Logical Drive'. 4) Click 'Yes'. If Windows asks you to restart the computer, do so. Then repeat the steps 1 and 2 and continue from the step 5. 5) Right-click the unallocated/free space area and select either 'New Partition', or 'New Simple Volume', or 'New Logical Drive'. 6) The 'New Partition Wizard' or 'New Simple Volume Wizard' window should appear now; follow its instructions. On the wizard page entitled 'Format Partition', select either 'Do not format this partition' or 'Do not format this volume'. In the same wizard, click 'Next' and then 'Finish'. 7) Note that the device path you have selected in VeraCrypt may be wrong now. Therefore, exit the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard (if it is still running) and then start it again. 8) Try encrypting the device/partition again.\n\nIf VeraCrypt repeatedly fails to encrypt the device/partition, you may want to consider creating a file container instead.</string>

A device that contains partitions can be entirely encrypted in place (using a single master key) only if it is the drive where Windows is installed and from which it boots.\n\nIf you want to encrypt the selected non-system device using a single master key, you will need to remove all partitions on the device first to enable VeraCrypt to format it safely (formatting a device that contains partitions might cause system instability and/or data corruption). Alternatively, you can encrypt each partition on the drive individually (each partition will be encrypted using a different master key).\n\nNote: If you want to remove all partitions from a GPT disk, you may need to convert it to a MBR disk (using e.g. the Computer Management tool) in order to remove hidden partitions.</string>
    <string lang="en" key="WHOLE_NONSYS_DEVICE_ENC_CONFIRM">Warning: If you encrypt the entire device (as opposed to encrypting only a partition on it), operating systems will consider the device as new, empty, and unformatted (as it will contain no partition table) and may spontaneously initialize the device (or ask you if you want to do so), which may damage the volume. Furthermore, it will not be possible to consistently mount the volume as favorite (e.g. when the drive number changes) or to assign a favorite-volume label to it.\n\nTo avoid that you may want to consider creating a partition on the device and encrypting the partition instead.\n\nAre you sure want to encrypt the entire device?</string>

The volume will be mounted to a different drive letter, which you select from the list in the main VeraCrypt window.\n\nThe original drive letter %c: should be used only in case you need to remove encryption from the partition/device (e.g., if you no longer need encryption). In such a case, right-click the drive letter %c: in the 'Computer' (or 'My Computer') list and select 'Format'. Otherwise, the drive letter %c: should never be used (unless you remove it, as described e.g. in the VeraCrypt FAQ, and assign it to another partition/device).</string>

(For more information, see the subsection 'Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes' in the documentation.)\n\n- In some cases, it is possible to determine that, at a certain time, a particular filesystem was not mounted under (or that a particular file on the filesystem was not saved or accessed from within) a particular instance of an operating system (e.g. by analyzing and comparing filesystem journals, file timestamps, application logs, error logs, etc). This might indicate that a hidden operating system is installed on the computer. The countermeasures prevent these issues.\n\n- It prevents data corruption and allows safe hibernation. When Windows resumes from hibernation, it assumes that all mounted filesystems are in the same state as when the system entered hibernation. VeraCrypt ensures this by write-protecting any filesystem accessible both from within the decoy and hidden systems. Without such protection, the filesystem could become corrupted when mounted by one system while the other system is hibernated.</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_TO_HIDDEN_OS_DATA_TRANSFER_HOWTO">Note: If you need to securely transfer files from the decoy system to the hidden system, follow these steps:\n1) Start the decoy system.\n2) Save the files to an unencrypted volume or to an outer/normal VeraCrypt volume.\n3) Start the hidden system.\n4) If you saved the files to a VeraCrypt volume, mount it (it will be automatically mounted as read-only).\n5) Copy the files to the hidden system partition or to another hidden volume.</string>

    <string lang="en" key="TRAVELER_LIMITATIONS_NOTE">Note about portable mode:\n\nPlease note that the operating system requires drivers to be registered with it before they can be started. Hence, the VeraCrypt driver is not (and cannot be) fully portable (whereas the VeraCrypt applications are fully portable, i.e. they do not have to be installed or registered with the operating system).

VeraCrypt needs a device driver to provide transparent on-the-fly encryption/decryption, and users without administrator privileges cannot start device drivers in Windows. Therefore, the system will ask you for permission to run VeraCrypt with administrator privileges (UAC prompt).\n\nNote that if you install VeraCrypt on the system (as opposed to running VeraCrypt in portable mode), the system will NOT ask you for permission to run VeraCrypt (UAC prompt) every time you attempt to run it.\n\nAre you sure you want to extract the files?</string>

If you do not have multiple operating systems installed on your computer, you can boot a WinPE or BartPE CD/DVD or you can connect your system drive as a secondary or external drive to another computer and then boot the operating system installed on the computer. After you boot a system, run VeraCrypt, click 'Select Device', select the affected system partition, click 'OK', select 'System' > 'Mount Without Pre-Boot Authentication', enter your pre-boot authentication password and click 'OK'.

    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_2">How to Create Decoy System Safely and Securely\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to achieve plausible deniability, you need to create the decoy operating system now. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_3">1) For security reasons, shut down your computer and leave it powered off for at least several minutes (the longer, the better). This is required to clear the memory, which contains sensitive data. Then turn on the computer but do not boot the hidden system.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_4">2) Install Windows on the partition whose content has been erased (i.e. on the partition where the original system, of which the hidden system is a clone, was installed).\n\nIMPORTANT: WHEN YOU START INSTALLING THE DECOY SYSTEM, THE HIDDEN SYSTEM WILL *NOT* BE POSSIBLE TO BOOT (because the VeraCrypt Boot Loader will be erased by the Windows system installer). THIS IS NORMAL AND EXPECTED. PLEASE DO NOT PANIC. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BOOT THE HIDDEN SYSTEM AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU START ENCRYPTING THE DECOY SYSTEM (because VeraCrypt will then automatically install the VeraCrypt Boot Loader on the system drive).\n\nImportant: The size of the decoy system partition must remain the same as the size of the hidden volume (this condition is now met). Moreover, you must not create any partition between the decoy system partition and the partition where the hidden system resides.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_5">3) Boot the decoy system (which you installed in step 2 and install VeraCrypt on it).\n\nKeep in mind that the decoy system must never contain any sensitive data.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_6">4) On the decoy system, run VeraCrypt and select 'System' &gt; 'Encrypt System Partition/Drive'. The VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window should appear.\n\nThe following steps apply to the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_7">5) In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard, do NOT select the 'Hidden' option. Leave the 'Normal' option selected and click 'Next'.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_8">6) Select the option 'Encrypt the Windows system partition' and then click 'Next'.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_9">7) If there are only the hidden system and the decoy system installed on the computer, select the option 'Single-boot' (if there are more than these two systems installed on the computer, select 'Multi-boot'). Then click 'Next'.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_10">8) IMPORTANT: In this step, FOR THE DECOY SYSTEM, YOU MUST SELECT THE SAME ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM AND HASH ALGORITHM THAT YOU SELECTED FOR THE HIDDEN SYSTEM! OTHERWISE, THE HIDDEN SYSTEM WILL BE INACCESSIBLE! In other words, the decoy system must be encrypted with the same encryption algorithm as the hidden system. Note: The reason is that the decoy system and the hidden system will share a single boot loader, which supports only a single algorithm, selected by the user (for each algorithm, there is a special version of the VeraCrypt Boot Loader).\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_11">9) In this step, choose a password for the decoy operating system. This will be the password that you will be able to reveal to an adversary if you are asked or forced to disclose your pre-boot authentication password (the other password you can reveal is the one for the outer volume). The existence of the third password (i.e. of the pre-boot authentication password for the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\nImportant: The password you choose for the decoy system must be substantially different from the one you chose for the hidden volume (i.e. for the hidden operating system).\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_12">10) Follow the remaining instructions in the wizard so as to encrypt the decoy operating system.\n\n\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_13">After Decoy System Is Created\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter you encrypt the decoy system, the whole process of creation of the hidden operating system will be completed and you will be able to use these three passwords:\n\n1) Pre-boot authentication password for the hidden operating system.\n\n2) Pre-boot authentication password for the decoy operating system.\n\n3) Password for the outer volume.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_14">If you want to start the hidden operating system, you will just need to enter the password for the hidden operating system in the VeraCrypt Boot Loader screen (which appears after you turn on or restart your computer).\n\nIf you want to start the decoy operating system, you will just need to enter the password for the decoy operating system in the VeraCrypt Boot Loader screen.\n\nThe password for the decoy system can be disclosed to anyone forcing you to reveal your pre-boot authentication password. The existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_15">The third password (for the outer volume) can be disclosed to anyone forcing you to reveal the password for the first partition behind the system partition, where both the outer volume and the hidden volume (containing the hidden operating system) reside. The existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_16">If you revealed the password for the decoy system to an adversary and he asked you why the free space of the (decoy) system partition contains random data, you could answer, for example: "The partition previously contained a system encrypted by VeraCrypt, but I forgot the pre-boot authentication password (or the system was damaged and stopped booting), so I had to reinstall Windows and encrypt the partition again."\n\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_17">If all the instructions are followed and if the precautions and requirements listed in the section "Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes" in the VeraCrypt User's Guide are followed, it should be impossible to prove that the hidden volume and hidden operating system exist, even when the outer volume is mounted or when the decoy operating system is decrypted or started.\n\nIf you save a copy of this text or print it (strongly recommended, unless your printer stores copies of documents it prints on its internal drive), you should destroy any copies of it after you have created the decoy system and after you have understood all the information contained in the text (otherwise, if such a copy was found, it might indicate that there is a hidden operating system on this computer).\n\n</string>
    <string lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_18">WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT PROTECT THE HIDDEN VOLUME (for information on how to do so, refer to the section "Protection of Hidden Volumes Against Damage" in the VeraCrypt User's Guide), DO NOT WRITE TO THE OUTER VOLUME (note that the decoy operating system is NOT installed in the outer volume). OTHERWISE, YOU MAY OVERWRITE AND DAMAGE THE HIDDEN VOLUME (AND THE HIDDEN OPERATING SYSTEM WITHIN IT)!</string>
    <string lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_CREATION_PREINFO_TITLE">Operating System Cloning</string>
    <string lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_CREATION_PREINFO_HELP">In the next steps, VeraCrypt will create the hidden operating system by copying the content of the system partition to the hidden volume (data being copied will be encrypted on the fly with an encryption key different from the one that will be used for the decoy operating system).\n\nPlease note that the process will be performed in the pre-boot environment (before Windows starts) and it may take a long time to complete; several hours or even several days (depending on the size of the system partition and on the performance of your computer).\n\nYou will be able to interrupt the process, shut down your computer, start the operating system and then resume the process. However, if you interrupt it, the entire process of copying the system will have to start from the beginning (because the content of the system partition must not change during cloning).</string>
    <string lang="en" key="CONFIRM_CANCEL_HIDDEN_OS_CREATION">Do you want to cancel the entire process of creation of the hidden operating system?\n\nNote: You will NOT be able to resume the process if you cancel it now.</string>

    <string lang="en" key="BOOT_PRETEST_FAILED_RETRY">The VeraCrypt system encryption pretest failed. Do you want to try again?\n\nIf you select 'No', the pre-boot authentication component will be uninstalled.\n\nNotes:\n\n- If the VeraCrypt Boot Loader did not ask you to enter the password before Windows started, it is possible that your operating system does not boot from the drive on which it is installed. This is not supported.\n\n- If you used an encryption algorithm other than AES and the pretest failed (and you entered the password), it may have been caused by an inappropriately designed driver. Select 'No', and try encrypting the system partition/drive again, but use the AES encryption algorithm (which has the lowest memory requirements).\n\n- For more possible causes and solutions, see: https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Troubleshooting</string>

Therefore, it is recommended that you first back up the files stored on the VeraCrypt volume to another, healthy, VeraCrypt volume.\n\nDo you want to repair the filesystem now?</string>
    <string lang="en" key="MOUNTED_CONTAINER_FORCED_READ_ONLY">Volume '%s' has been mounted as read-only because write access was denied.\n\nPlease make sure the security permissions of the file container allow you to write to it (right-click the container and select Properties > Security).\n\nNote that, due to a Windows issue, you may see this warning even after setting the appropriate security permissions. This is not caused by a bug in VeraCrypt. A possible solution is to move your container to, e.g., your 'Documents' folder.\n\nIf you intend to keep your volume read-only, set the read-only attribute of the container (right-click the container and select Properties > Read-only), which will suppress this warning.</string>
    <string lang="en" key="MOUNTED_DEVICE_FORCED_READ_ONLY">Volume '%s' had to be mounted as read-only because write access was denied.\n\nPlease make sure no other application (e.g. antivirus software) is accessing the partition/device on which the volume is hosted.</string>
    <string lang="en" key="MOUNTED_DEVICE_FORCED_READ_ONLY_WRITE_PROTECTION">Volume '%s' has been mounted as read-only because the operating system reported the host device to be write-protected.\n\nPlease note that some custom chipset drivers have been reported to cause writable media to falsely appear write-protected. This problem is not caused by VeraCrypt. It may be solved by updating or uninstalling any custom (non-Microsoft) chipset drivers that are currently installed on this system.</string>
