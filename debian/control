Description: Cross-platform on-the-fly encryption
 VeraCrypt provides cross-platform on-the-fly encryption for Linux, MacOS X and
 Windows. It can encrypt filesystems stored either within a file or on disk
 partitions. Supported encryption algorithms include AES, Serpent and Twofish.
 The current version uses the XTS mode of disk encryption. In addition,
 VeraCrypt supports "hidden volumes" - unidentifiable volumes present in the
 free-space of a VeraCrypt volume.
